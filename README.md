# MSKBD - Modularly Simple KeyBoarD

> [!WARNING]  
> This is the dev branch!

A customizable modular keyboard system where each key cluster is its own module, connected through a grid-like commnication. The goal is to create a flexible keyboard that can scale, reconfigure layouts, and support hot-swapping modules.

## Features
- 🧩 **Modular design** — attach modules in any direction
- 🎛️ **Configurable firmware** — master + module code, easily updated
- ⚡ **Hotplug detection** — modules can be discovered dynamically

## Repo Structure
```
├─firmware/ - Embedded code for the core system
├─hardware/ - Schematics and PCB layouts
├─software/ - Host tools (keymap editor, etc.) (not yet implemented - soon hopefully!)
├─docs/ - Design notes, communication protocol, build guides
└─assets/ - Renders, diagrams, and media
```
